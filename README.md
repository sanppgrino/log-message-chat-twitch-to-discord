# Twitch to Discord Bot

## Project Overview
This project is a bot that allows you to record Twitch messages to a Discord channel. This can be useful for moderation and for keeping a record of messages, even if the live stream replay is deleted.

## Installation and Usage Instructions
You have two options:
- Take the code and use it as you see fit.
- Use the bot I created to support me.

## A Little Backstory
I struggled to get the Twitch bot to communicate directly with the Discord bot, so I decided to have the messages first transmitted to the terminal, and the Discord bot would then use them to send to the designated channel.

Please note that this is my first project. I may have made mistakes or complicated things for myself, but I am satisfied with it and had a lot of fun.

Take care and see you soon!
